## 👋 About

I’m a **Platform Engineer** focused on building **reusable, production-grade cloud infrastructure** using Infrastructure as Code.  
My work emphasizes **clean architecture**, **environment isolation**, and **automation-first design** rather than one-off scripts.

I enjoy designing systems that other engineers can safely reuse, extend, and operate at scale.

---

## 🧩 What I Build

- Terraform platforms with reusable modules and workspace-isolated state
- Azure and AWS infrastructure (networking, compute, IAM, AKS/EKS)
- Kubernetes platform foundations
- CI/CD and GitOps-friendly infrastructure
- Multi-environment architectures (dev / stage / prod)

---

## ⭐ Featured Project

**Azure Terraform Platform**  
A reusable Terraform platform that provisions Azure networking, AKS, compute, and RBAC using a **single codebase** and **workspace-driven configuration**.

**Key characteristics:**
- Environment-agnostic modules
- Workspace-isolated remote state
- Configuration-driven sizing and behavior
- No hardcoded environments or embedded secrets
- CI-safe and GitHub-ready

👉 See: `azure-terraform-platform`

## 🧠 Engineering Principles

- Configuration over hardcoding  
- Reusability over duplication  
- State isolation by default  
- Secure by design (no secrets in code)  
- Automation-first, CI-friendly workflows  

---

## 📚 Currently Exploring

- Advanced Kubernetes patterns
- GitOps workflows (Argo CD)
- Platform engineering best practices
- Observability and service mesh fundamentals
